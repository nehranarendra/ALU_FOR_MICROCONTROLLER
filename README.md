# ALU_FOR_MICROCONTROLLER

The Verilog code defines an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs various operations based on a 4-bit mode selection. It supports operations like addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, increment, decrement, shifts, and complement. It computes status flags (Zero, Carry, Sign, Overflow) and provides an output based on the selected operation when the enable signal is active. The ALU's behavior is determined by the mode input and operands.
